## Hey there! You can call me Tristan.

I'm a Software Engineer and generally creative in and outside of tech.

I have an interest in networks and backend infrastructure. Currently learning frontend technologies to supplement my backend and data focused projects.
I also love learning new programming languages and solving problems in esoteric programming languages (esolangs).
Additionally, I have experience in machine learning and AI, applied cryptography, and computer vision, Arduino/RPi and generally working on microcontrollers.

My most comfortable languages are Python, Go, and C, but I consider myself proficient and able to dive right into C++, C#, Rust, Typescript, JavaScript, ARM, and HTML + CSS.

Currently looking for work, based in the SF Bay Area.
