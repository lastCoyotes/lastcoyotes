# Hey, I'm Tristan! (You may also recognize me as Lake)

I am a recent CS graduate and Artist.
I'm a first generation Asian American and nonbinary (they/them). 

Everything I publish to this Github is projects for my portfolio,
for volunteering my work amongst LGBTQ+/BIPOC/furry communities, or just for fun!

I have an interest in machine learning and data analytics,
but I also like to challenge myself with learning new languages and frameworks.

Nearly finishing an additional mechanical engineering major and a minor in math,
I unfortunately had to graduate sooner with what I had due to the pandemic and financial strain the quarantine had caused.

I have experience in working with embedded systems, robotics, aeronautics, and AI.

Artwise, I graduated with a minor in Studio Arts where I focused in printmaking and painting.

Aside from that though, I know my way around digital art, 3D modeling and all that it may entail (rigging, UV mapping, etc),
and I apply these skills towards graphic and web design, game design/AI, and visualizing data.
